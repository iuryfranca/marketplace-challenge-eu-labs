## :dart: About

<p>
this is an easy to understand project, i just needed to create a mini ecommerce with business rules that the company came up with. here you will find a list of products, controllers for adding and removing them from the cart, the cart itself, the cart details page, finally the payment and success page
</p>

<p>
to develop this, some technologies were used: Quasarjs, which was responsible for starting the project and making UI components available, Vuejs 3, Pinia for state management, lucide icons for the icons, axios to perform http requests and finally, it was used scss to style the application
</p>
